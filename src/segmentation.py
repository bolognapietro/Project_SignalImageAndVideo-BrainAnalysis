"""
Provides functions for the 2D segmentation of MRI brain images. 
It can be tested with different algorithms:

- `K-means <https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means>`_

The goal is to extract three regions (segments) of interest:

- Grey matter.
- Cerebrospinal fluid.
- White matter.

They can be later classified using the appropriate function inside the classify module.
